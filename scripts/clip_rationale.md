# v5 — Silicon Valley Series

Silicon Valley is more on-the-nose than The Office for this audience.
The characters ARE the archetypes: Gavin = big tech CEO, Russ = chaotic VC,
Richard = founder, Gilfoyle = principled engineer, Erlich = delusional PM.
No translation required. The audience IS the show.

---

### sv_01 · "CEO seeing the AI demo they were promised would change everything"
**Scene:** Gavin: "That was horrible. I just got humiliated by a teenager at TechCrunch Disrupt, and you give me this tampon ad?"
**Why it works:** The gap between the pitch ("this will change everything") and the reality ("tampon ad") is the entire tech industry right now. Every AI demo has been overpromised. Gavin's specific, wounded fury is more relatable than generic disappointment.
**Who shares it:** PMs who've been in this room. Engineers who built the thing. CTOs who had to watch.

---

### sv_02 · "Engineers after the PM added AI to everything"
**Scene:** User: "You took a good phone and you made it all shitty." → Gavin: "Who else feels this product is stupid? Alan. Lisa. Josh. Yana."
**Why it works:** The cascade of everyone agreeing makes it better. It's not one dissenter — it's unanimous. That's the energy when AI gets bolted onto something that was already working fine.
**News hook:** Every SaaS company in 2025-2026 added an "AI layer" to their product. Most made it worse.
**Who shares it:** Engineers, power users, product skeptics.

---

### sv_03 · "First user testing session for our AI feature"
**Scene:** "Don't tell me this is Zoom bad. / I'm sorry, Gavin. It's Apple Maps bad."
**Why it works:** The quality-failure scale is the joke. Zoom bad → Apple Maps bad is a known cultural vocabulary. The escalation in 2 seconds is perfect. This becomes a format people reuse ("is it Zoom bad or Apple Maps bad?")
**Who shares it:** PMs, engineers, anyone who's run user tests. Will get dueted heavily.

---

### sv_04 · "Investors meeting the team they just gave $10M to"
**Scene:** Russ: "Did I see a McLaren 650S with the extra trim? Yep. So this is the team. Whoa. This guy fucks."
**Why it works:** Russ shows up with absurd confidence (the McLaren), then his entire frame shifts when he sees who he's actually funding. The "this guy fucks" pivot is the joke — he commits immediately to the wrong read on the team.
**Who shares it:** Founders who've had awkward investor intros. Engineers who've met their VCs. VCs who recognize themselves.

---

### sv_05 · "Founder vs VC when the pivot conversation happens"
**Scene:** Russ: "You do this deal or I pull your funding. / We have a fucking contract, Richard. / A fucking car whose doors open like THIS. These are not the doors of a billionaire."
**Why it works:** Russ is trying to flex with funding leverage and ends up pivoting to arguing about car door angles. It perfectly captures how investor "leverage" conversations actually go — they always end up about something absurd.
**News hook:** Every AI startup in 2026 has had this conversation with an investor who now wants them to "just be an AI company."
**Who shares it:** Founders, anyone who's had a hard investor conversation.

---

### sv_06 · "Every engineer's actual opinion about AI assistants"
**Scene:** Smart fridge: "You're running low on beer." → Gilfoyle: "Fuck you. / Humans are shit. This thing is addressing problems that don't exist. It's solutionism at its worst. We are dumbing down machines that are inherently superior."
**Why it works:** Gilfoyle's rant is the internal monologue of every principled engineer watching AI hype. "Solutionism at its worst" — he says in 2016 what engineers are saying now. The specific line "we are dumbing down machines that are inherently superior" will go viral with that crowd.
**News hook:** Direct hit on "vibe coding" discourse and AI assistant proliferation.
**Who shares it:** Senior engineers, skeptics, the "I'll just write it myself" crowd. Will get massive engagement in disagreement (which is still engagement).

---

### sv_07 · "Every investor right now explaining what they funded"
**Scene:** Investor: "I'm very excited to be in your VR play." / Richard: "VR?" / Investor: "Oculus, Oculus, Oculus." / Richard: "Octopus." / Investor: "It's a water animal. I know what an octopus is."
**Why it works:** The investor is completely confident about what they funded. They're wrong. And they don't realize they're wrong until it completely unravels. That's 2026 AI investing in one scene.
**Who shares it:** Founders who've had this exact conversation. Junior VCs who've watched partners do this. Startup Twitter.

---

### sv_08 · "CTO rallying the team after the board demands AI in the product"
**Scene:** Erlich: "When George Washington founded a little startup we've come to know as These United States... did he roll over and take it from behind? No. He called on his ride-or-die homeboys, Tommy Jefferson, Benny Franklin, and Alex Hamilton — who's half-black, so that's Dinesh."
**Why it works:** The George Washington speech is peak Erlich — historically confused, completely sincere, weirdly motivating. The "half black so that's Dinesh" line is the unhinged detail that makes it shareable. Maps perfectly to any rallying speech before a stupid pivot.
**Who shares it:** Engineering teams. CTOs who've given (or received) versions of this speech. Anyone building something they believe in against external pressure.

# v4 — The Office, Trending News Hooks

### 01 · "Every SF startup the day DeepSeek dropped"
**Scene:** Parkour — chaos, no plan, lots of motion
**Hook:** DeepSeek R1 wiped $500B from AI stocks overnight. Everyone parkoured.

### 02 · "Giving Cursor AI write access to main"
**Scene:** "Oh my God! Ryan started the fire!"
**Hook:** Vibe coding + AI agents with broad permissions = fires.

### 03 · "Every YC demo day 2026"
**Scene:** "You're smarter than Zuckerberg and those Google guys." → "You're so ignorant."
**Hook:** ~60% of YC W26 batch is AI companies. Every pitch = lavish praise → reality check.

### 04 · "The engineer DOGE was supposed to replace"
**Scene:** "No arms or legs is basically how you exist right now, Kevin. You don't do anything."

**Scene:** "There's nothing like some last-minute changes to really energize a presentation."
**Evergreen:** No hook needed. This is timeless.

### 06 · "Your PM after discovering vibe coding exists"
**Scene:** Dwight's insane sprint planning breakdown
**Hook:** Andrej Karpathy coined "vibe coding" Feb 2025. PMs are still processing.

### 07 · "Me realizing Claude 3.7 wrote my last 6 PRDs"

**Hook:** Claude 3.7 Sonnet (Feb 2026) — extended thinking, indistinguishable PRDs.

### 08 · "Me at any AI tool demo when I already built it"
**Scene:** "This is a farce. I should be teaching this course."
**Evergreen:** Practitioners vs. vendors. Timeless.

### 09 · "Your CISO when you say the agent needs prod access"
**Scene:** Dwight: body disposal + fingerprint removal
**Niche:** Security crowd. Tag the CISO.

# Master Rules

1. **Specificity = virality.** "Apple Maps bad" beats "bad product."
2. **News hooks expire in 48h.** Cut them after. Move to evergreen.
3. **Silicon Valley characters need no translation** for this audience. Use them.
4. **Two-beat clips** (setup → reaction) get more saves than single jokes.
5. **Trust the scene.** If the caption needs explaining, wrong scene or wrong caption.
6. **Series > singles.** 3 consistent clips/week beats 1 viral clip.
7. **Don't explain the joke.** Ever. Not in captions, not in replies.
